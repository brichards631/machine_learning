This was a regression cumulative project that I did for the Codecademy "Build a Machine Learning Model Skill Path." The task was to develop a machine learning model that would be trained on restaurant information given by Yelp in order to predict what a restaurant's star rating would be based off the features in the dataset. This was my first real machine learning project that I have done on my own, and I am proud of my accomplishments.
